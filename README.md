# Spatiotemporal Persistent Homology for Dynamic Data

A **dynamic metric space (DMS)** is a time series of distance functions over a fixed underlying set. Instance of DMSs include collective behaviors of animals (a flock of birds or a school of fish), and social networks in the human sphere.

The code in this repository works to 
1. Compute the **spatiotemporal persistent Betti-0 function** of **DMSs**, and in turn
2. Quantify the dissimilarity between two DMSs, based on their **spatiotemporal persistent topology**. For this, we make use of a slight generalization of [the erosion distance](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41468-018-0012-6) by Amit Patel.

In addtion, using this code, users can generate various DMSs according to [Boids model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).

<!--This code fill out the computational pipeline of taking in a dynamic metric space (DMS) generating a spatiotemporal Betti-0 function for it, and then compute erosion distance between these Betti-0 functions.--> 
The code is based on theoretical work by [Woojin Kim](https://wj-kim.com) and [Facundo MÃ©moli](https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1/) at Ohio State (see [*Spatiotemporal Persistent Homology for Dynamic Metric Spaces*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-019-00168-w), published in Discrete & Computational Geometry, 2020).

## Spatiotemporal Betti-0 function computation
<!--All of the codes are currently set up to be run from a command line, for example, the current approach to run "betti_generator.py" would be to enter command line or the terminal in a python IDE and write something such as:
```
python betti_generator.py [dmsfile] [bettifile] 40 0 50 5
```
All of these codes have portions at the top of main where the user can change the approach to how these functions are called/executed to another method as desired. Later, code will also be posted that exemplifies a larger-scale version with parallelization for generating Betti-0 functions as well as computing erosion distance between a large number of Betti-0 functions. -->

"betti_generator.py" is code that takes in a DMS file and generates a Betti-0 function for that DMS. It currently has one set of initial parameters:

```
python betti_generator.py [dmsfile] [bettifile] [num_points] [start_threshold] [end_threshold] [spacing]
```

[dmsfile] and [bettifile] are the names of the files containing the input DMS and the output Betti-0 function, respectively. [num_points] is the number of points in the DMS (will soon be unecessary to input manually). The threshold and spacing inputs determine the discretization values to be used for the Vietoris-Rips filtration when generating the Betti-0 function. Consider the following example input:

```
python betti_generator.py DMS1.txt Betti.txt 30 0 50 5
```

Then, for computing the Betti-0 function of **DMS1.txt**, the Vietoris-Rips complexes will be computed at the thresholds  0 (=**start_threshold**), 5, 10, ..., 50 (=**end_threshold**) and the Betti-0 function will be saved into a file named **Betti.txt**.
The code is currently built so that the DMS file it reads in is a dynamic point cloud and then it computes the time series of distance matrices using Euclidean distance in the function "get_dist". This "get_dist" function is the one to change should the DMS be based on other metrics. In the future, additional functionality will be added so the user could input either a DMS as a dynamic point cloud or as a time series of distance matrices already. Of note is that the "boids_simulation.py" output is a dynamic point cloud, as the current "betti_generator.py" code is setup to handle.

## Generating DMSs from Boids model
"boids_simulation.py" is code that uses a standard flocking boids model to generate DMSs, and is added to give the user an example of how to generate DMS, as well as to have easily-made DMS available to test with the other codes.
This code has two sets of initial parameters (again, this can be changed at the top of main):

```
python boids_simulation.py [num_points] [separation_force] [alignment_force] [cohesion_force] [dmsfile]
```

or:

```
python boids_simulation.py [num_points] [separation_force] [separation_radius] [alignment_force] [alignment_radius] [cohesion_force] [cohesion_radius] [dmsfile]
```

The forces and radii are parameters that alter the motion of the boids based on the rules based on the rules of the model. For a general explanation of the flocking boids model, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids. Then [dmsfile] is the filename that the DMS data is saved out to.
